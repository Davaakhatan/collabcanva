# Firebase Connection Test

## Current Issue
- 3 users on same canvas
- PresenceList shows "0 people" 
- No cursors visible
- Console shows cursor updates being sent but no subscription logs

## Missing Console Logs
You should see these logs but they're missing:

```javascript
// Should see:
📡 [Cursor Service] Subscribing to cursors at: projects/.../canvases/.../cursors
👥 [Cursor Service] Received cursor data: {path: "...", hasData: true, userCount: 3, rawData: {...}}
📥 [useCursors] Received cursor update: {totalUsers: 3, allUserIds: ["user1", "user2", "user3"]}
```

## Debug Steps

### 1. Check Firebase Console
1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/collabcanva-d9e10
2. Go to: **Realtime Database**
3. Look for data at: `projects` → `{your-project-id}` → `canvases` → `canvas-1` → `cursors`
4. **You should see cursor data for all 3 users**

### 2. Check Console for Firebase Errors
Look for these error messages:

```javascript
// Firebase connection errors
🔥 [Cursor Service] Firebase subscription error: [error details]

// Realtime Database initialization errors
Realtime Database initialization failed: [error details]
Multiplayer cursors and presence features will be disabled

// Demo configuration warnings
⚠️ Using demo Firebase configuration. Please set up your .env file with real Firebase credentials
```

### 3. Check Firebase Configuration
The issue might be:
- **Demo Firebase config** (using fallback values)
- **Realtime Database not enabled**
- **Database rules not deployed**
- **Wrong Firebase project**

## Quick Fix Test

### Test 1: Check Firebase Data
1. Open Firebase Console
2. Go to Realtime Database
3. Navigate to: `projects` → `{project-id}` → `canvases` → `canvas-1` → `cursors`
4. **If you see cursor data**: Firebase is working, issue is with subscription
5. **If you see nothing**: Firebase isn't receiving data

### Test 2: Check Console Logs
Look for these specific logs in all 3 browsers:

```javascript
// Should see in ALL browsers:
📡 [Cursor Service] Subscribing to cursors at: projects/.../canvases/.../cursors
👥 [Cursor Service] Received cursor data: {path: "...", hasData: true, userCount: 3, rawData: {...}}
```

### Test 3: Manual Firebase Test
1. Go to Firebase Console → Realtime Database
2. Manually add data at: `projects/test/canvases/canvas-1/cursors/user1`
3. See if it appears in the app

## Expected Behavior

### If Working Correctly:
1. **All 3 browsers** show PresenceList with "3 people"
2. **Colored cursors** appear and move in real-time
3. **Console logs** show subscription and data received
4. **Firebase database** has cursor data at correct path

### Current Problem:
- Only cursor updates being sent (🖱️ logs)
- No subscription logs (📡 logs missing)
- No data received logs (👥 logs missing)
- PresenceList shows 0 people

## Possible Causes

### 1. Firebase Realtime Database Not Enabled
- **Symptom**: No data in Firebase Console
- **Solution**: Enable Realtime Database in Firebase Console

### 2. Demo Firebase Configuration
- **Symptom**: Console shows "⚠️ Using demo Firebase configuration"
- **Solution**: Check if using real Firebase credentials

### 3. Database Rules Not Deployed
- **Symptom**: Firebase subscription errors about permissions
- **Solution**: Deploy database rules

### 4. Wrong Firebase Project
- **Symptom**: Data not appearing in Firebase Console
- **Solution**: Check if using correct Firebase project ID

## Next Steps

1. **Check Firebase Console** for cursor data
2. **Check console logs** for Firebase errors
3. **Verify Firebase project** is correct
4. **Check if Realtime Database** is enabled

**Check the Firebase Console now and let me know what you see!** This will help us identify if it's a configuration issue, rules issue, or connection problem.
