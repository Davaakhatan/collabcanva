   - Delete shapes → Undo → Redo

2. **Keyboard Shortcuts**:
   - Test all shortcuts listed above
   - Verify they work with different shapes selected

3. **Alignment Tools**:
   - Create 3+ shapes in different positions
   - Select one shape
   - Test all 6 alignment options
   - Verify shape moves to correct position

4. **Z-index Management**:
   - Create overlapping shapes
   - Use bring to front/back buttons
   - Use keyboard shortcuts Cmd+[ and Cmd+]

5. **Color Picker**:

### AI Agent Test
1. **Basic Commands**:
   - "Create a red circle at 500, 300"
   - "Make a 3x3 grid of blue squares"
   - "Add text that says Hello World"

2. **Complex Commands**:
   - "Create a login form"
   - "Make 5 colorful circles in a row"
   - "Create a navigation bar"

3. **Response Time**: Should be < 2 seconds
4. **Accuracy**: Verify shapes are created as requested

### Performance Test
1. **Stress Test**:
   - Open performance panel
   - Click "+50", "+100", "+200" buttons
   - Monitor FPS (should stay above 40 FPS)
   - Test with 500+ shapes

2. **Smoothness**:
   - Pan and zoom with many shapes
   - Verify no lag or stuttering

### Multi-User Collaboration Test
1. **Open in Two Browsers**:
   - Login with different accounts
   - Both users create shapes
   - Verify real-time sync

2. **Lock Mechanism**:
   - User A selects a shape (should show blue border)
   - User B sees red border (locked)
   - User B tries to edit → should be blocked
   - User A deselects → User B can edit

3. **Cursor Tracking**:
   - Both users move mouse
   - Verify cursors appear in real-time
   - Test "jump to user" feature

## 🚨 Critical Issues to Verify

### 1. Demo Video (REQUIRED - -10 penalty if missing)
- **Duration**: 3-5 minutes
- **Content**: Show 2+ users, multiple AI commands, advanced features
- **Quality**: Clear audio/video, good lighting

### 2. Real-time Synchronization
- **Object sync**: < 100ms
- **Cursor sync**: < 50ms
- **No lag during rapid edits**

### 3. Conflict Resolution
- **Lock mechanism works**
- **No ghost objects**
- **Stale locks auto-unlock (10s timeout)**

### 4. Persistence & Reconnection
- **Refresh page**: Exact state restored
- **Network drop**: Auto-reconnects
- **Connection status indicator**
