## Testing Protocol

### Test 1: Solo User Experience
1. Login/Signup flows
2. Create shapes (all 5 types)
3. Move, resize, rotate
4. Delete shapes
5. Pan and zoom
6. Export PNG
7. Use AI commands
8. Change colors
9. Manage z-index

### Test 2: Multi-User Collaboration
1. Two users log in
2. Both create shapes
3. User A selects shape → User B sees red border
4. User B tries to edit → BLOCKED
5. User A deselects → User B can edit
6. Both users use AI simultaneously
7. Verify cursor tracking

### Test 3: Performance & Stability
1. Add 100 shapes → Check FPS
2. Add 500 shapes → Check FPS
3. Rapid edits → Check responsiveness
4. Network disconnect → Verify reconnection
5. Refresh page → Verify persistence

### Test 4: AI Agent
1. "Create a red circle at 500, 300"
2. "Make a 3x3 grid of blue squares"
3. "Create a login form"
4. "Add 5 colorful circles in a row"
5. Verify <2 second responses
6. Verify accuracy
