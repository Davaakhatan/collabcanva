# Product Requirements Document: Multi-Project System

## Introduction/Overview

Transform CollabCanvas from a single-canvas application into a multi-project collaborative design platform similar to Figma. Users will be able to create, manage, and collaborate on multiple design projects, each containing one or more canvases. This feature will provide project organization, team collaboration, and a professional workspace experience.

## Goals

1. **Project Management**: Enable users to create, organize, and manage multiple design projects
2. **Team Collaboration**: Allow project sharing with different permission levels (viewer, editor, admin)
3. **Professional Workspace**: Provide a Figma-like dashboard for project discovery and management
4. **Seamless Navigation**: Enable easy switching between projects and canvases
5. **Project Organization**: Support project categorization, search, and filtering
6. **Data Isolation**: Ensure each project has its own data namespace and security

## User Stories

### Project Creation & Management
- **As a user**, I want to create new projects from the dashboard so that I can organize my work
- **As a user**, I want to name and describe my projects so that I can identify them easily
- **As a user**, I want to set project thumbnails so that I can visually identify projects
- **As a user**, I want to delete or archive projects so that I can manage my workspace

### Project Navigation
- **As a user**, I want to see all my projects in a dashboard so that I can quickly access them
- **As a user**, I want to search and filter projects so that I can find specific work
- **As a user**, I want to see recent projects so that I can quickly return to recent work
- **As a user**, I want to organize projects into teams/folders so that I can group related work

### Team Collaboration
- **As a project owner**, I want to invite team members to projects so that we can collaborate
- **As a project owner**, I want to set permission levels (viewer/editor/admin) so that I can control access
- **As a team member**, I want to see projects I've been invited to so that I can access shared work
- **As a user**, I want to see who else is working on a project so that I can coordinate

### Canvas Management
- **As a user**, I want to create multiple canvases within a project so that I can organize different designs
- **As a user**, I want to rename and organize canvases so that I can manage project content
- **As a user**, I want to duplicate canvases so that I can create variations

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Project Dashboard
1.1. The system must display a grid/list view of all user projects
1.2. The system must show project thumbnails, names, descriptions, and last modified dates
1.3. The system must provide search functionality to find projects by name or description
1.4. The system must show recent projects prominently
1.5. The system must display project member avatars and online status
1.6. The system must provide quick actions (open, share, duplicate, delete) for each project

### 2. Project Creation
2.1. The system must allow users to create new projects with name and description
2.2. The system must generate project thumbnails automatically from canvas content
2.3. The system must assign unique project IDs for data isolation
2.4. The system must create a default canvas when a new project is created
2.5. The system must set the creator as the project admin

### 3. Project Settings & Management
3.1. The system must allow project owners to edit project name, description, and settings
3.2. The system must support project deletion with confirmation
3.3. The system must support project archiving (soft delete)
3.4. The system must maintain project activity history
3.5. The system must support project duplication

### 4. Team Collaboration
4.1. The system must allow project owners to invite users via email
4.2. The system must support three permission levels: Viewer (read-only), Editor (can edit), Admin (full control)
4.3. The system must show project member list with roles and online status
4.4. The system must send email notifications for project invitations
4.5. The system must allow project owners to remove team members
4.6. The system must support project transfer to another admin

### 5. Canvas Management within Projects
5.1. The system must allow multiple canvases per project
5.2. The system must provide canvas creation, renaming, and deletion
5.3. The system must show canvas thumbnails and names in project view
5.4. The system must support canvas duplication within projects
5.5. The system must maintain canvas order and organization

### 6. Navigation & Routing
6.1. The system must provide routes: `/projects` (dashboard), `/projects/:id` (project view), `/projects/:id/canvas/:canvasId`
6.2. The system must maintain breadcrumb navigation
6.3. The system must provide quick project switching
6.4. The system must remember last accessed project/canvas

### 7. Data Architecture
7.1. The system must isolate project data using Firebase collections: `projects/{projectId}/canvases/{canvasId}/shapes`
7.2. The system must maintain project metadata in `projects/{projectId}/metadata`
7.3. The system must store team memberships in `projects/{projectId}/members`
7.4. The system must implement proper Firebase security rules for project access

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- **File Import/Export**: Not implementing project import/export in MVP
- **Project Templates**: Not creating project templates in initial version
- **Advanced Permissions**: Not implementing granular permissions beyond viewer/editor/admin
- **Project Analytics**: Not tracking detailed project usage analytics
- **Project Comments**: Not implementing project-level commenting system
- **Version History**: Not implementing project-level version control
- **Project Folders**: Not implementing nested folder organization in MVP

## Design Considerations

### UI/UX Requirements
- **Dashboard Layout**: Grid-based project cards similar to Figma's dashboard
- **Project Cards**: Show thumbnail, name, description, member avatars, last modified
- **Navigation**: Top navigation with project breadcrumbs
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly project management
- **Empty States**: Helpful empty states for new users and empty projects

### Visual Design
- **Consistent with Current Design**: Maintain existing gradient themes and glassmorphism
- **Project Thumbnails**: Auto-generated from canvas content with fallback to default
- **Member Avatars**: Circular avatars with online status indicators
- **Action Buttons**: Consistent with current TButton component styling

## Technical Considerations

### Firebase Structure
```
projects/
  {projectId}/
    metadata: { name, description, thumbnail, createdAt, updatedAt, ownerId }
    members/
      {userId}: { role: 'admin'|'editor'|'viewer', joinedAt }
    canvases/
      {canvasId}/
        shapes: { ... existing shape data }
        metadata: { name, thumbnail, createdAt, updatedAt }
```

### Security Rules
- Project access based on membership in `projects/{projectId}/members`
- Role-based permissions for read/write operations
- Owner has full control, admins can manage members, editors can edit, viewers read-only

### Performance
- Lazy load project thumbnails
- Paginate project list for users with many projects
- Cache project metadata for quick navigation

## Success Metrics

1. **User Engagement**: 80% of users create multiple projects within first week
2. **Collaboration**: 60% of projects have multiple team members
3. **Navigation**: Users can find and switch between projects in <3 seconds
4. **Adoption**: 90% of existing users successfully migrate to multi-project system
5. **Performance**: Project dashboard loads in <2 seconds with 50+ projects

## Open Questions

1. **Migration Strategy**: How should we handle existing single-canvas users?
2. **Project Limits**: Should there be limits on number of projects per user?
3. **Storage Quotas**: How should we handle project storage limits?
4. **Notification System**: Should we implement real-time notifications for project activities?
5. **Project Discovery**: Should we support public project sharing or discovery?
6. **Canvas Limits**: Should there be limits on number of canvases per project?
