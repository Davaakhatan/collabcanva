# Cursor Fix Verification

## ✅ **Deployment Complete!**

The fix has been deployed to: https://collabcanva-d9e10.web.app

## 🔧 **What Was Fixed**

The issue was that the `useCursors` hook was being called without proper `projectId` and `canvasId` parameters, causing it to fall back to the global path `sessions/global-canvas-v1` instead of the canvas-specific path `projects/{projectId}/canvases/{canvasId}/cursors`.

### **Changes Made:**

1. **Added validation in `useCursors` hook** (`src/hooks/useCursors.ts`):
   ```typescript
   // Don't initialize if projectId or canvasId are missing
   if (!projectId || !canvasId) {
     console.warn('⚠️ [useCursors] Missing projectId or canvasId, skipping initialization:', { projectId, canvasId });
     return;
   }
   ```

2. **Enhanced debugging** in `src/services/cursor.ts`:
   - Added detailed logging for Firebase subscription
   - Added error handling for Firebase connection issues

## 🧪 **Test the Fix**

### **Step 1: Open the App**
1. Go to: https://collabcanva-d9e10.web.app
2. Login with your account
3. Navigate to a project and canvas

### **Step 2: Check Console Logs**
You should now see these logs in the console:

```javascript
// ✅ Should see these logs:
🎯 [useCursors] Initializing for: {userId: "...", projectId: "project_...", canvasId: "canvas-1"}
📡 [Cursor Service] Subscribing to cursors at: projects/project_.../canvases/canvas-1/cursors
👥 [Cursor Service] Received cursor data: {path: "...", hasData: true, userCount: 1, rawData: {...}}
📥 [useCursors] Received cursor update: {totalUsers: 1, allUserIds: ["user1"]}
```

### **Step 3: Test with Multiple Users**
1. Open the app in **3 different browsers** (or incognito windows)
2. Login with **3 different accounts**
3. Navigate to the **same project and canvas** in all browsers
4. Check the **PresenceList** - it should show "3 people" instead of "0 people"
5. Move your mouse in one browser - you should see **colored cursors** in the other browsers

### **Step 4: Check Firebase Console**
1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/collabcanva-d9e10
2. Go to: **Realtime Database**
3. Look for data at: `projects` → `{your-project-id}` → `canvases` → `canvas-1` → `cursors`
4. **You should see cursor data for all 3 users**

## 🚨 **If Still Not Working**

### **Check Console for These Errors:**

```javascript
// ❌ If you see these, there's still an issue:
⚠️ [useCursors] Missing projectId or canvasId, skipping initialization: {projectId: undefined, canvasId: undefined}
🔥 [Cursor Service] Firebase subscription error: [error details]
Realtime Database initialization failed: [error details]
```

### **Possible Issues:**

1. **Firebase Realtime Database not enabled**
   - Go to Firebase Console → Realtime Database
   - Make sure it's enabled

2. **Database rules not deployed**
   - The rules should allow read/write access to `projects/{projectId}/canvases/{canvasId}/cursors`

3. **Wrong Firebase project**
   - Make sure you're using the correct Firebase project ID

## 🎯 **Expected Behavior**

### **Working Correctly:**
- ✅ PresenceList shows "3 people" (not "0 people")
- ✅ Colored cursors appear and move in real-time
- ✅ Console shows subscription and data received logs
- ✅ Firebase database has cursor data at correct path

### **Current Problem (Before Fix):**
- ❌ PresenceList shows "0 people"
- ❌ No cursors visible
- ❌ Console shows cursor updates being sent but no subscription logs
- ❌ Firebase database has data under `presence` instead of `projects/{projectId}/canvases/{canvasId}/cursors`

## 🔍 **Debug Steps**

1. **Check the console logs** - look for the specific logs mentioned above
2. **Check Firebase Console** - verify data is being stored at the correct path
3. **Test with multiple users** - make sure all users are on the same project and canvas
4. **Check network tab** - look for Firebase Realtime Database connections

**The fix should now work! Test it with multiple users and let me know what you see in the console logs.** 🚀
